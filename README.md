RT2D Framework
====

For making the game i used a framework called RT2D. Its a simple c++ renderer framework in wich you can make simple games.

Jumpy
====

`Jumpy` is a simple game made in the RT2D framework.
`Jumpy` is inspired to be a tower jumper, in wich you must jump to higher `platforms` to stay alive.

All the `platforms` always move down slowly and when you are out of the screen the game will end.

There are `object` falling down from the top of the screen. If you hit any of these `objects` the game also ends, so always Jumpyaway when one is coming right for you!

Your `score` can also been seen and your `highscore` will be saved. Each `platform` you jump on will add one point to your score.
